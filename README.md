# Passport JWT with Nest.js and Typeorm

This repo is meant to be a boilerplate example utilizing Nest.js, Typeorm, and Passport JWT / Local Strategies. 

# Technologies Used
[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

[TypeOrm](https://typeorm.io/)

[Passport](https://www.passportjs.org/)


<sub>Note: I have been toying with an idea for an application for the last three years. At times I've felt paralyzed by the 'paradox of choice' (too many choices, not sure which way felt like the 'right' way to go). After two years of experiments, trials and errors I've finally decided on the stack I plan on using (Ionic/Angular, NestJS, and Typeorm).<sub>

<sub>This repository was originally the start of one of my 'experiments'. I have decided to publicize it for research purposes only, and to hopefully help other developers who might be struggling with deciding what stack to use in their own applications.
